# ALPACA ML: Automated Learning and Prototyping for Athletics and Creative Activity with Machine Learning 
# What is this App?
The wearable toolkit is an all purpose wearable that can be used with a variety of different activities. A bluetooth speaking device, in this case the BBC Microbit, is placed on the users body. This board is then connected to an IOS app on the users Iphone. The code for this app is what you see in this Github. This app will allow the user to video tape themselves, or have another person record them, while recieve sensor data from the bluetooth device, which for now is accleration data. The app will graph the data, and with the help of machine learning, learn to classify actions based off of the users criteria. The app could tell you if your swing is too slow, if you are extending to far out to one side, and more, not just with sports but  in other fields as well. Please note that work is still in program so the app is far from fully developed.
